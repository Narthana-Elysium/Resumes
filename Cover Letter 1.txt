Dear Hiring Manager ,

I am writing to express my interest for Networking or any internship or job opportunity in your company , as advertised. With a strong foundation in IT, SEO, system administration, and technical training, I bring a unique blend of analytical thinking, communication skills, and hands-on experience that aligns well with your non-coding internship roles.

During my tenure as an SEO Analyst at MyInception Tech, I successfully improved search engine rankings and website traffic through strategic keyword research and performance monitoring using tools like Google Analytics and SEMrush. My role as a Trainer at Elysium Academy further honed my ability to simplify complex technical concepts and deliver impactful sessions in programming and networking.

I am currently working as an Inside Sales Executive at Mentor Infocomm, where I showcase products, engage with clients, and contribute to sales strategy—skills that I believe are highly transferable to roles in marketing, business development, and customer success.

My certifications in CCNA and CEH, along with hands-on experience in system administration and web development, equip me to adapt quickly and contribute meaningfully to dynamic teams. I am particularly drawn to [Company Name] because of its commitment to innovation and its diverse internship offerings that go beyond traditional coding roles.

I would welcome the opportunity to bring my enthusiasm, versatility, and dedication to your team. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your organization and growing through this internship experience.

Warm regards,  
Narthana Krishnaraj
