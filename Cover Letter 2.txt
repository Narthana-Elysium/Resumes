Dear Hiring Manager,

I bring IT, SEO, system administration, and training experience tailored for non‑coding roles. At MyInception Tech, I increased traffic through keyword optimization and analytics. At Elysium Academy, I distilled complex networking concepts into accessible training. Now, at Mentor Infocomm, I connect with clients and shape sales strategy—skills transferrable to marketing and client-facing functions.

Holding CCNA and CEH certifications plus web development and admin expertise, I’m drawn to [Company Name]’s innovative non‑coding internships. I’d love to contribute my versatility and technical grounding to your team.

Thank you for considering my application.

Warm regards,
Narthana
